# Chapter 7. Other Design Methods

> 其他设计方法

Over the past two decades, a number of architecture design methods have been proposed and documented.

We begin with a “general model” of architecture design, then briefly present five other design methods. We conclude the chapter with a discussion of how ADD differs from these other methods.
